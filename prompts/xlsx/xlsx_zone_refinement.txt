Given a macro-region from an Excel sheet and the list of cells in that region,
identify sub-rectangles that look like answer areas (e.g. bordered, blank
blocks).  The input is a JSON object with keys "region" and "cells".  Return a
JSON array of zones where each zone has:

  zone_id: short id
  sheet: sheet name (copy from region)
  r1, c1, r2, c2: bounds of the sub-rectangle
  reason: brief justification

Input JSON:
{{data}}

Respond only with valid JSON.
