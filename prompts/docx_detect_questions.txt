You are given JSON describing consecutive blocks from a DOCX file. Each item includes a global 'index' and 'text'. Identify all blocks that explicitly request information, either in interrogative form (e.g., questions ending with '?', like "Does your firm have...?", "What are your...?") or in imperative form (commands that ask for information, like "Please describe...", "Please provide...", "Explain..."). Do NOT flag narrative statements or descriptions that do not ask for information (e.g., "Our firm uses...", "The audit was conducted..."). Return STRICT JSON of the form {"questions": [0,5,12]} (empty list if none).
