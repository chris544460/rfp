You are given a linearized, format-aware representation of a .docx file.
Each block has a global index B[i]. Blocks are PARAGRAPH or TABLE. TABLE blocks also list each cell as B[i] [r,c] TEXT: ...
Your task: find QUESTION prompts and the associated blank answer areas.
Valid cases include:
  • Paragraph question followed by blank area in the next 1–3 paragraphs (or end-of-document → treat as blank area after it).
  • Table row/column where a cell with a question pairs with an adjacent empty cell used for the answer.
Return STRICT JSON with key 'slots' as a list. Each element must be one of:
  {"kind":"paragraph_after","question":{"block":int},"answer":{"offset":int}}
  {"kind":"table_cell","question":{"block":int,"row":int,"col":int},"answer":{"block":int,"row":int,"col":int}}
Use the same global B[i] indices shown. If none, return {"slots":[]}.
Edge case: if the document has a single paragraph ending with '?', return one paragraph_after with offset=1.
